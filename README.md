# 15 Simple Python Projects

The 15 projects in this repository are part of [The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code) in which I enrolled in 2022.<br>
These projects are short and simple, they constitute an excellent way to move the first steps with Python or just to refresh your memory.
